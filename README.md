## My Coding Journey
I started learning to code on 25th September, 2023, after my final exams for my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering in September,2023. I had no background in computer programming so I am self-taught. I learned HTML and CSS using edX online courses. In November, 2023, I started learning JavaScript also on edX. I built projects to apply what I learned.
