# Arinze's Portfolio
## About Me
My name is Arinzechukwu Dennings Owoh. I am a Nigerian Front-End Web Developer living in Abuja, Nigeria.
## My Coding Journey
I started learning to code on 25th September, 2023, after my final exams for Bachelor's Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering in September, 2023. I had no background in computer programming so I am self-taught. I learned HTML and CSS using edX online courses. In November, 2023, I started learning JavaScript also on edX. I build projects along the way to apply what I learn. I started learning Git and joined GitHub on 31st December, 2023. February 2024, I decided to brush up on fundamentals with Havard's "CS50 Introduction to Computer Science" course on edX while building a game with Vanilla JavaScript (inspired by table tennis of course). I will keep updating this part of my portfolio as I learn more technologies...

## My Challenges
These are the challenges I faced in my coding journey and how I overcame them. For project-specific challenges please navigate into the projects' README files.
* Initial frustrations and burnout
  * I would take a walk or a nap.
* Difficulty understanding fundamental concepts
  * I would use YouTube videos to single out any confusing concept/topic and grasp it before going back to my edX course.
  * I would also use ChatGPT. This is more applicable than YouTube when I am not confused about an entire topic but about something unexplained/unexpected in the course or my codes. I would interrogate ChatGPT as if it were a person.
* Self-doubt
  * I would remind myself of my past achievements in endeavours that demanded logical reasoning like National Speedcubing Competitions, National Maths Olympiads, Aptitude competitions in High School and College and SAT Maths. These self-validation enable me to keep pushing.
* Difficulty staying motivated
  * I would listen to motivational speakers like Bob Proctor, Gary Vaynerchuk, Andy Elliott or call my brother who is a web developer and mentor.
* Physical stress due to long working hours
  * I invested in an ergonomic chair and laptop stand to raise my line of sight, reduce neck strain and improve posture.
  * I invested in a monitor, external keyboard and external mouse to improve workflow.
