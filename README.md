## My Coding Journey

After completing my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I embarked on a self-taught coding journey with no prior background in computer programming. I began with `HTML` and `CSS` through online courses, quickly progressing to `JavaScript`, while building mini projects to reinforce my learning.

To strengthen my fundamentals, I completed [Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science) course while developing a [vanilla JavaScript game](https://github.com/ArinzeGit/Bouncing-Battle-Game) inspired by table tennis. This project marked the culmination of my learning in `vanilla JavaScript`.

With a solid foundation in `JavaScript`, I advanced to learning `React`, `React-TypeScript`, and `Bootstrap`, focusing on building dynamic and interactive applications. To tackle the challenges of modern web design, I took the [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell), which helped me master complex responsive design techniques and layouts.

To bridge the gap between design and development, I completed the [From Figma to Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/from-figma-to-code) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This course taught me to effectively translate `Figma` design files into pixel-perfect websites, enhancing my ability to build visually accurate and responsive web pages.

Understanding the importance of `quality assurance`, I delved into `unit testing` and `integration testing` with `Jest` and `React Testing Library`. Later, I replaced `Jest` with `Vitest` for better compatibility with my `Vite` build tool. Additionally, I adopted `Tailwind CSS` to streamline my styling workflow.

Recently, I began learning `Next.js`, the React framework for production-ready web applications. Its `server-side rendering` (SSR) and `static site generation` (SSG) capabilities have expanded my ability to build more efficient and `SEO-friendly` web applications, while still leveraging my existing `React` knowledge.

My journey is one of continuous growth and exploration, and I am excited to keep learning and building innovative web applications. üòÉ

## My Challenges

These are the challenges I faced in my coding journey and how I overcame them. For project-specific challenges please navigate into the projects' README files.

- Initial frustrations and burnout
  - I would take a walk or a nap.
- Difficulty understanding fundamental concepts
  - I would use YouTube videos to single out any confusing concept/topic and grasp it before going back to my edX course.
  - I would also use ChatGPT. This is more applicable than YouTube when it's not an entire topic but something unexplained/unexpected in the course or my codes. I would interrogate ChatGPT as if it were a person.
- Self-doubt
  - I would remind myself of my past achievements in endeavours that demanded logical reasoning like National Speedcubing Competitions, National Maths Olympiads, Aptitude competitions in High School and College and SAT Maths. These self-validation enable me to keep pushing.
- Difficulty staying motivated
  - I would listen to motivational speakers like Bob Proctor, Dan Koe and Gary Vaynerchuk or call my brother who is a web developer and mentor.
- Physical stress due to long working hours
  - I invested in an ergonomic chair and laptop stand to raise my line of sight, reduce neck strain and improve posture.
  - I invested in a monitor, external keyboard and external mouse to improve workflow.
