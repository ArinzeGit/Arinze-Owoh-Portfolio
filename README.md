## My Coding Journey

- I started learning to code on **25th September 2023**, after my final exams for Bachelor's Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering in September, 2023. I had no background in computer programming so I am self-taught. I learned `HTML` and `CSS` using [edX](https://www.edx.org/) online courses.
- In **November 2023**, I started learning `JavaScript` also on edX. I built mini projects along the way to apply what I learned.
- On **31st December 2023**, I started learning `Git` and joined `GitHub`.
- In **February 2024**, I decided to brush up on `fundamentals` with Havard's [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science) course on edX while building a [vanilla JavaScript game](https://github.com/ArinzeGit/Bouncing-Battle-Game) (inspired by table tennis!), to mark the end of vanilla JavaScripting.
- In **March 2024**, I finished building the game, finished Havard's CS50 course and finally started learning the long awaited `React-JS` framework.
- In **April 2024**, I started learning `React-TypeScript` and `Bootstrap` CSS framework and building dynamic apps with them. I practiced mainly using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.
- In **May 2024**, responsiveness got more tricky as design layouts got more complex so I took the [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).
- Thus far, I built from PDF designs files so in **June 2024**, I took the [From Figma to Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/from-figma-to-code) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) to learn to build from Figma design files.
- In **July 2024**, I started learning `Unit Testing` with `Jest Framework` and `React Testing Library` on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
- Still **July 2024**, I started learning and using `Tailwind CSS`
- In **August 2024**, I learned and switched to Vitest from Jest because it offered better compatibility with my Vite bundler.
- I will keep updating this journey as I learn more technologies.üòÉ

## My Challenges

These are the challenges I faced in my coding journey and how I overcame them. For project-specific challenges please navigate into the projects' README files.

- Initial frustrations and burnout
  - I would take a walk or a nap.
- Difficulty understanding fundamental concepts
  - I would use YouTube videos to single out any confusing concept/topic and grasp it before going back to my edX course.
  - I would also use ChatGPT. This is more applicable than YouTube when it's not an entire topic but something unexplained/unexpected in the course or my codes. I would interrogate ChatGPT as if it were a person.
- Self-doubt
  - I would remind myself of my past achievements in endeavours that demanded logical reasoning like National Speedcubing Competitions, National Maths Olympiads, Aptitude competitions in High School and College and SAT Maths. These self-validation enable me to keep pushing.
- Difficulty staying motivated
  - I would listen to motivational speakers like Bob Proctor and Gary Vaynerchuk or call my brother who is a web developer and mentor.
- Physical stress due to long working hours
  - I invested in an ergonomic chair and laptop stand to raise my line of sight, reduce neck strain and improve posture.
  - I invested in a monitor, external keyboard and external mouse to improve workflow.
