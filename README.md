## My Coding Journey

I began learning to code in September 2023, shortly after my Bachelor's in Electrical/Electronics Engineering. With no prior background in programming, I embarked on a self-taught path through various online courses.
- `HTML` & `CSS`: Started with [edX](https://www.edx.org/) courses to learn the basics.
- `JavaScript`: In November 2023, I took `JavaScript` courses on edX and built mini projects to apply my knowledge.
- `Git` and `GitHub`: Learned `Git` and joined `GitHub` in December 2023.
- `CS Fundamentals` and `Game Development`: In February 2024, I completed Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science) course while building a [vanilla JavaScript game](https://github.com/ArinzeGit/Bouncing-Battle-Game).
- `React` and `TypeScript`: Began learning `React` and `TypeScript` in March 2024, followed by `Bootstrap` and `Tailwind CSS`. Practiced through [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.
- `Responsive Design`: Took [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)'s "[Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts)" course in May, 2024 to tackle complex layouts.
- `Design-to-Code`: Completed "[From Figma to Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/from-figma-to-code)" on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) in June, 2024 to build from `Figma` design files.
- `Unit Testing`: Learned `Jest` and `React Testing Library` on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) in July, 2024, later transitioning to `Vitest` for better `Vite` bundler compatibility.

I am excited to continue this journey and will keep updating my progress as I explore new technologiesüòÉ

## My Challenges

These are the challenges I faced in my coding journey and how I overcame them. For project-specific challenges please navigate into the projects' README files.

- Initial frustrations and burnout
  - I would take a walk or a nap.
- Difficulty understanding fundamental concepts
  - I would use YouTube videos to single out any confusing concept/topic and grasp it before going back to my edX course.
  - I would also use ChatGPT. This is more applicable than YouTube when it's not an entire topic but something unexplained/unexpected in the course or my codes. I would interrogate ChatGPT as if it were a person.
- Self-doubt
  - I would remind myself of my past achievements in endeavours that demanded logical reasoning like National Speedcubing Competitions, National Maths Olympiads, Aptitude competitions in High School and College and SAT Maths. These self-validation enable me to keep pushing.
- Difficulty staying motivated
  - I would listen to motivational speakers like Bob Proctor and Gary Vaynerchuk or call my brother who is a web developer and mentor.
- Physical stress due to long working hours
  - I invested in an ergonomic chair and laptop stand to raise my line of sight, reduce neck strain and improve posture.
  - I invested in a monitor, external keyboard and external mouse to improve workflow.
