# CSS Challenge
## Context
This project was the final challenge of the "Try It: CSS Fundamentals" edX course. This was my first CSS course. I was given an HTML file and required to add CSS styling to it so that it matched a given design.
## How to run
* Ensure you have a modern web browser installed
* Open the index.html file in your web browser
* The project should now be visible in your browser
## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
## Challenges faced during development
* I could not make sections render side by side as sections are block elements by default
  * I learnt about the display property and used the value of inline-block
